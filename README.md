# Fake Venmo
SCDT's XSS Demo, but 10% sillier <br />
We had an XSS Demo like 4 years ago, but um we lost access to that Github sooo
<br /><br />
By the way, if this looks cursed, it probably is. That's because I quite literally cloned the Venmo website and tried to fill in the CSS files I didn't have access to.

# How to run
Step 1: 
```bash
docker pull mongo
```
<br />

Step 2:
```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```
God I'm lowkey starting to love containerization. I've never seen such simple instructions before.
